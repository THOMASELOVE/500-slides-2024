# Some Closing Thoughts

## A Few Advantages of Propensity Methodology

- Results can be persuasive even to audiences with limited statistical training.
- Though estimating the PS requires some care, the comparability of treated and control patients can be verified simply.
- PS methods address selection bias well.
- PS methods may be combined with other sorts of adjustments.

## Strategic Issues

- How can we make our investigations compelling to our intended audience?
- Why is this hard?
    - Audience is not focused on statistical techniques
    - Audience may have limited training in statistics
- Why is this important?
    - Who makes key policy decisions?
    - Who needs to be convinced by the evidence?
- Design observational studies
    - Exert as much experimental control as possible, carefully consider the selection process, and anticipate hidden biases
- Focus on simple comparisons
    - Increase impact of results on consumers
- Compare subjects who looked comparable prior to treatment
- Use sensitivity analyses to delimit discussions of hidden biases due to unobserved covariates

## Some Cautions and Limitations

- Hidden Bias: Beware unmeasured covariates which affect outcomes and/or assignment.
    - Sensitivity Analysis helps quantify the problem
- This is a reasonable method with fairly large samples.
    - Matching vs. stratification vs. adjustment methods
- Options narrow as an investigation proceeds. 
    - Sadly, though OS work cries out for design, weâ€™re often working with secondary data, where we have fewer options

## What should always be done in an OS ... and often isn't?

1. Collect data so as to be able to model selection
2. Demonstrate need for adjustment - selection bias
3. Carefully record intervention time - adjust only for things present before or at time of  intervention.
4. Ensure baseline characteristic overlap [comparability]
5. Check baseline characteristic balance after adjustment
6. Specify relevant post-adjustment population with care 
7. Estimate treatment effect in light of adjustment
8. Estimate sensitivity of results to potential hidden bias

## How Can We Avoid Being Misled by Observational Studies?

1. What differentiates an observational study from a randomized controlled trial?
    - One key element: potential for selection bias.
2. What is selection bias, and why should I care about it?
    - Baseline characteristics of comparison groups are different in ways that affect the outcome.
3. What can be done to deal with selection bias in observational studies?
    - Propensity score methods for overt bias.
    - Sensitivity analyses to deal with hidden bias.

## Thank you very much.
