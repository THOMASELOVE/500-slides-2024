# Our R Examples

## The `toy` example

The `toy` example presents methods for doing 1:1 greedy matching without replacement using the `Match` function from the `Matching` package, and for evaluating the balance before and after matching with `cobalt` and with an alternative strategy for obtaining Love plots.

- The example uses 3 Rules I attribute to Rubin (2001) for determining when a sample comparison shows sufficient balance to allow for a reasonable regression model for the outcome. 
    - **Please read** Rubin (2001) in advance of Class 6, which will mostly be about that example.
- What to do in terms of a sensitivity analysis is discussed in the final section of that example, and we'll get to that later on.

## The `lindner` example

The `lindner` example also does 1:1 greedy matching on the linear propensity score, in this case however there are more treated subjects than controls, so the default greedy approach taken is to not match all treated subjects, since you run out of controls before you get to them all. 

- 1:1 nearest neighbor matches are demonstrated, first without replacement (in Task 4) and then **with** replacement (in Task 6).
- The "with replacement" matching has some appealing features, not least of which being that now we can realistically create ATT estimates (since we match all treated subjects to a control, repeating some controls.)
    - The match quality (in terms of a Love plot) is much better with replacement in this case.
    - This does come with a cost, though. Most subjects are matched just a few times, but some are included more than 50 times!
    
## The `dm2200` example

This example is solely about matching, and not things like subclassification, weighting and so on. The data are simulated, again, and I'm not really focusing on the outcome models, but rather just on demonstrating how to do the matching, and how to evaluate the quality of the covariate balance.

## `dm2200`: First Four Matches

We demonstrate the use of both the `Matching` package and the `MatchIt` package. First, using `Matching`, which is what `toy` and `lindner` use, we show:

1. 1:1 nearest neighbor matching without replacement
2. 1:2 nearest neighbor matching without replacement
3. 1:3 nearest neighbor matching with replacement
4. 1:1 nearest neighbor matching without replacement within a caliper on the (linear) propensity score

## `dm2200`: Four Additional Matches

Using the `MatchIt` package, we demonstate:

1. 1:1 nearest neighbor matching without replacement
2. 1:1 nearest neighbor matching without replacement within a caliper on the (linear) propensity score
3. 1:1 optimal matching without replacement
4. 1:2 optimal matching without replacement

There are multiple other packages in the world for propensity matching, and `cobalt` describes and supports several of them, but these are the two I have most often used.

- `MatchIt` has some features I really like, in particular, it's easier to work with it in `cobalt`, I think, and it also has one very annoying feature, in that it's hard to get the matched data set from it.

# Matching Approaches (discussion built on Austin, 2014)

## 1:1 Greedy Matching

Greedy (or nearest neighbor) matching selects a treated subject and then selects as a matched control subject the untreated subject whose propensity score is closest to that of the treated subject. If multiple untreated subjects are equally close to the treated subject, one of these untreated subjects is selected at random, typically. Options include:

1. Select treated subjects from highest to lowest propensity score.
2. Select treated subjects from lowest to highest propensity score.
3. Select sequentially treated subjects in the order of the best possible match. 
    - First treated subject is the one who is closest to an untreated subject. 
    - Second treated subject is the one closest to the remaining untreated, etc.
4. Select treated subjects in a random order. Set a fixed random number seed so that the matched sample is reproducible in subsequent analyses.

Results in all treated subjects being matched to a single control.

## Greedy Matching with Replacement

Matching *without* replacement means that once an untreated subject has been matched to a treated subject that untreated subject is no longer eligible for further matches to other treated subjects. As a result, each subject can be in at most one matched pair.

Now, in matching *with* replacement, we allow members of the "control" pool to be reused in the matching process.

- The process is somewhat simpler in the nearest neighbor case - just match each treated subject to the closest untreated subject.
- Because untreated subjects are recycled and thus can be included in multiple matched sets, the order in which the treated subjects are selected has no effect on the formation of matched pairs.

## Matching 1:k rather than 1:1

Here, we simply try to obtain the k best matching untreated subjects for each treated subject.

- In greedy matching, it is certainly possible that the quality of matches will drop considerably with extra matches, especially near the edges of the distribution of the propensity score.
- 1:k matching is occasionally done with replacement, but of course we still want k unique matched untreated subjects for each treated subject.

## Caliper Matching

Match subjects only if they fall within a pre-specified maximum distance (the caliper distance.)

- When using caliper matching, we usually match subjects on the logit of the propensity score using a caliper width as a proportion of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score.
- Caliper matching can be combined with other distance metrics (where, for example, a few specific covariates are targeted for more precise matching.)
- Matching with a caliper can be accomplished with or without replacement, and in 1:1 or 1:k settings.

## Optimal Matching

The main distinction that matters is between optimal matching approaches and nearest-neighbor (greedy) matching approaches.

- Optimal matching forms matched pairs so as to minimize the average within-pair difference in propensity scores.
- Optimal matching is rarely the first way I run an analysis (it's a bit slow, especially with large matching problems) but this problem is disappearing as smarter people and more effective computers emerge.

## Double Robust Approaches 

Nothing is stopping us from using regression adjustment along with matching. It's not unusual to consider the incorporation of the linear propensity score, or an important set of prognostic covariates in a setting where we are analyzing propensity-matched subjects.

## Austin's conclusions re: 12 Algorithms

- Larger numbers of matched pairs (from complete optimal or complete greedy matches) yields more precise estimates than smaller numbers of matched pairs (say, when a caliper is used and only some treated subjects are matched.)
- Caliper matching often yields better "balance" and less biased estimates as compared to other algorithms.
- So we have a bias - variance tradeoff in our estimation strategies, but in terms of MSE, caliper matching usually performs pretty well.
- In terms of ordering of treated subjects for greedy matching or caliper matching, random selection is competitive with other options.
- Optimal matching is pretty comparable to nearest neighbor matching with random selection order, and in fact, it's not clearly any better than that approach.

## Abstract of Ahmed et al.

![](c05/figures/ahmed_2012_2.png)

## From the Introduction

> The majority of heart failure (HF) patients are ≥65 years, and most
deaths and HF-related hospitalizations in HF patients occur in this
patient group. We have previously demonstrated that in a
propensity-matched cohort of ambulatory patients with mild to
moderate chronic HF, older age ($\geq 65$ years) was associated with
increased mortality but not hospitalization.

The objective of the current study was to examine the independent effect of older age on outcomes in chronic advanced systolic HF patients using a propensity-matched design.

## Data Source and Subjects

> This study was conducted using retrospective analysis of public-use copies of the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) datasets obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

> BEST was a multicenter randomized controlled trial of the beta-blocker bucindolol in chronic systolic HF.

Patients with advanced systolic HF were enrolled from 90 different sites
across the United States and Canada. All patients had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%.

## Exposure and Outcomes

Exposure: We categorized (2707) patients into two age groups: younger ($< 65$ years) and older ($\geq 65$ years; n = 1091 or 40%).

Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, HF mortality and all-cause hospitalization. All outcomes were centrally adjudicated.

## Greedy Matching Approach

> Using a greedy matching protocol described elsewhere in detail, we were able to match 603 of the 1091 older patients with 603 patients $< 65$ years old who had similar propensity scores.

We began by using a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model to estimate propensity score for age $\geq 65$ years for each of the 2707 participants. In the model, an age $\geq 65$ years was used as the dependent variable and all clinically relevant baseline characteristics
(see Fig. 1, in two slides) were included as covariates.

- The matching process used an SPSS macro published in the second edition of Levesque R, ed. *A Guide for SPSS and SAS Users* 2005. 

## Propensity Matching Results

Before matching, older patients were more likely to have coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease than younger patients. 

After matching, absolute standardized differences between age groups
were $< 10$% for all measured covariates (with the exception of white
blood cell count which was 10.2%) with most values $< 5$% demonstrating
substantial covariate balance across the groups (Love plot, next slide.)

## Love Plot (Figure 1)

## All-Cause Mortality Effect?

All-cause mortality occurred in 33% (202/603) and 36% (215/603)
of matched younger and older patients respectively during 4 years of
follow-up. 

The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality when older patients are compared to younger patients was HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.87 - 1.27.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, in patients with advanced chronic systolic HF, older
age is an important marker of increased mortality and hospitalization,
but has no intrinsic effect on outcome. Therapeutic decisions in older
adults with advanced HF should not be biased on the basis of age alone.
