## Today's Agenda

Today's class involves a walk-through of the `toy` example, which is a simple simulated observational study of a treatment on three outcomes (one quantitative, one binary, and one time-to-event) which we will use to demonstrate the completion of 13 tasks using R, which include:

- Fitting a propensity score model
- Assessing pre-adjustment balance of covariates
- Estimating the effects of our treatment on our outcomes ...
    - Using matching on the propensity score
    - Using subclassification on the propensity score
    - Using direct adjustment for the propensity score
    - Using weighting on the propensity score

Note we have three other (more realistic) examples we'll share in time: `lindner`, `dm2200` and `rhc`.

# The `toy` Example

## The `toy` example

The `toy` example presents methods for doing 1:1 greedy matching without replacement using the `Match` function from the `Matching` package, and for evaluating the balance before and after matching with `cobalt` and with an alternative strategy for obtaining Love plots.

- The example uses 3 Rules I attribute to Rubin (2001) for determining when a sample comparison shows sufficient balance to allow for a reasonable regression model for the outcome. 
    - **Please read** Rubin (2001) in advance of Class 06, which will mostly be about that example.
- What to do in terms of a sensitivity analysis is discussed in the final section of that example, and we'll get to that later on.
